# Merasteem

MeraSteem is a project that helps businesses by providing resources to get them off of the ground. In other words, MeraSteem acts as a launchpad for new ideas. It is an Open Source social network and communications platform which extends itself to a variety of rich features and functionality including free digital payments and a marketplace for goods and services.
